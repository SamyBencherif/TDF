    <h1>TDF Language and Development Manual</h1>

    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
    This document serves as a guide to all things TDF related. TDF is a
    format. TDF is a language. TDF is a way of life. Whether you are
    here to further develop the language, create bindings, or write or
    prove code in TDF, it is important that you understand all sides of
    the language. TDF is a domain specific language. That is to say, we
    forgo some of the advantages of using popular general purpose
    languages in exchange for a whole slew of special advantages.
    The reduced feature set will simplify proving code. Licensing
    issues will not exist and we will not find ourselves relying on
    code that may seem reliable but actually comes from somewhere
    unpredictable, such as a nightly build, for random instance. Most
    importantly, In-house development means our team will have a
    special intimate knowledge of the language we are using.

    <h2 id="naming">Naming Conventions</h2>

    <p>
    First a number of points.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use snake casing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do NOT use abbrevations for any significant constructs. This
          includes function names, structure fields, and global
          variables.
        </li>
        <li>
          Abbreviations may be used sparingly for temporary pointers,
          such as function arguments where typename is sufficiently
          descriptive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do NOT use ambiguous abbreviations. For example "dev" can be
          short for either "development" or "device".
        </li>
        <li>
          Naming convention does NOT replace documentation and
          comments.
        </li>
        <li>
          In documentation and comments, casing of programmatic
          identifiers should prefer declared casing over grammatic
          standard. For example a sentence that starts with the name of
          a variable that is lower cased should begin lower cased.
          Variable names and other programmatic identifiers should be
          in single quotes. Filenames are consided like programmatic
          identifiers. In general if its casing has significance, it is
          treated like a programmatic identifier.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>TDF Constructs</h3>

    <p>
    All TDF keywords and literal values are in full uppercse. Devices
    are in uppercase. Names for abort sequences can be in any casing,
    but the casing must be used consistently. Units are always
    lowecased, to help keep them distinguishable from literals and
    keywords. TDF constructs that are described in more than one word
    may be optionally expresed via snake casing (ex: NO_DEVICE). The
    exception is that keywords, referred to in C under the type name
    'mode', may NOT contain underscores. Multiple word keywords are
    simply concatinated (ex: NOOP, LOGMSG, LOGSENSOR).
    </p>

    <h3>C Constructs</h3>

    <p>
    TDF programs are stored in memory and processed in a manner that is
    reminiscent of Object-Orientation. This design choice reduces the
    amount of code that handles bytecode-like objects. Object-
    Orientation structures may or may not be involved in program
    execution. Use of the structures in analysis, profiling, and
    compilation, however is uncontested. Data structures and functions
    for the TDF program are largely contained in the object-model.h
    source file. Structures, collections of c-type variables known as
    fields, are named in lowercase. For example, the data structure
    that holds a precompiled TDF program is called 'program'. This name
    includes a pointer declaration by default. Significant structures
    in general include a pointer definition in their typedef. functions
    that belong to a data structure are prefixed with the name of the
    structure. For example, 'program_new' and 'program_free', are both
    functions that belong to the 'program' data structure. All
    functions, structures, and types are named in lowercase.
    Contrastingly, all enums are in full uppercase. Enums represent
    literal values or keywords that are used in TDF programs.
    </p>

    <h3>Filenames</h3>

    <p>
    Recall that files 'README.md' and 'Makefile' are named as they are
    for practical and historical reasons. Other files in the codebase
    will typically be in "kebab-case", where spaces are replaced with
    a dash (ascii 0x2d). Some exceptions may be made, for example with
    'testbed', which is clearly understood as one word, even though it
    may not appear as a compound-noun in most dictionaries. All source
    filenames should not any contain uppercase letters.
    </p>

    <p>
    File extensions should be lowercase, unless there is a critical
    reason to do otherwise. Text files should have extensions. Prefer
    'info.txt' over 'info'. Avoid uncommon file extenstions such as
    '.log'. Executable files without extenstions are OK on platforms
    other than windows
    </p>

    <h2 id="development">Development</h2>

    <p>
    This manual contains information about development that will remain
    constant throughout the project's lifetime. Standards, practices,
    will be included here as well. It is important to read this section
    completely before moving on to the next reference document. Project
    structure, compilation, development tools, and integration will be
    discussed. Once you have completed this section, see
    development-status.txt for information about the current steps and
    history of development; most recent comments are stored at the top
    of the file.
    </p>

    <p>
    The project root may only contain two files, 'README.md' and
    'Makefile'. 'README.md' serves as an entry point to a new reader of
    the codebase. This file must contain instructions for compilation
    and configuration, reference further documentation, and contain
    relevant contact information. The file, 'Makefile', serves as an
    entry point for the compiler. Here various build profiles may be
    specified, including options for different platforms. Build
    configuration flags may be included as well. For example a build
    configuration flag could be used to enable a "debug" or
    "simulation" mode.
    </p>

    <p>
    Everything else in project root should be a directory. Each
    directory has a special purpose, detailed as follows.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>bin: Compiler Output. Binaries and Object Files (.o)</li>
        <li>docs: Documentation (.txt, .html)</li>
        <li>include: Header Files (.h)</li>
        <li>lib: Library Files (.a)</li>
        <li>src: Source Files (.c)</li>
        <li>testbed: Test Bed Workspace (.df)</li>
        <li>vim-TDF: Vim Syntax Support for TDF (.vim)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Practices</h3>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>All memory management functions must be tested in Valgrind.
        </li>
        <li>Control structures must use curly bracket syntax ({}).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 id="comments">Reading and Writing Comments</h2>

    <p>
    Every structure or function must be preceeded by a block comment
    annotation. This annotation must provided information how to use
    the object and how it works. Annotations are different from
    reference literature, as not everything makes into the reference.
    Objects described in the reference documents are intended for
    external use, whereas annotations cover everything. Entries in the
    references will obviously be more detailed. Annotations are
    required before significant structures. Comments that explain the
    behavior and choices surrounding procedural codes are expected
    within as well.
    </p>

    <h3>Annotation Requirements</h3>

    <p>
    Annotation writing is guided by a template of tagged fields. It is
    not necessary to specify the types of the arguments, as that is
    plainly visible from the function header, instead the arguments
    semantic significance should be revealed. Consider the following
    example of a block annotation for a function.
    </p>

    <pre>
    /*
     * Does math, specifically preforms and returns a sum.
     * @author P. Ward
     * @param x the first number
     * @param y the second number
     * @return the sum of x and y.
     */
    </pre>

    <p>
    The annotation helps us to understand the function before even
    seeing the header. Now have a look at the header.
    </p>

    <pre>
    int math_add(int x, int y);
    </pre>

    <p>
    No surprises there. The definition probably wouldn't be too
    surprising either. This is how it should be. Nobody likes
    surprises. It goes without saying that the author of an
    annotation must be the person who wrote the corresponding code.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="images/portal2-chell-surprise.png" width=100>
    </p>

    <p>
    A complete function annotation will begin with a description,
    followed with an @author tag, supply one @param tag for each
    argument
    with descriptions, finally a @return tag includes information
    about what is being returned.

    The description should detail any side-effects or significant
    computations as well as explain the general purpose of the
    function.

    The only difference with an struct
    annotation, besides the lack of a @return tag, is instead of using
    @param tags, you will use @field tags to similarly describe the
    objects. For enums use @val tags, to describe the significance of
    each type; let the main description be about the type of the enum.
    Here are some more examples. The main description is in written
    in paragraph form. Tag values are often singleton lists of
    descriptions. The tag values of W would be written as X, Y, Z where
    "W is X, W is Y, and W is Z" is a logical sentence describing W.
    This format encourages brevity and parallel phrasing as well as
    discorages phrasing such
    as "X does Y" or "Z is used to do so-and-so". Fields and values do
    NOT do anything, only functions do. It is important not to cross
    the concepts of data and routine, especially when the data concerns
    itself of the routines of a hosted language.

    <pre>
    /*
     * A person structure is used to keep track of some relevant health
     * information.
     * @author J.G. Quintel
     * @field height how tall a person is, measured in meters
     * @field mass how matter is in a person, measured in kg
     * @field bmi Body Mass Index, derived by formula, required to be
     *            updated to correspond with width and height
     */
    struct person
    {
      float height;
      float mass;
      float bmi;
    }
