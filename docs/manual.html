<!-- This document is optimized for conversion to text formats, as well
  as immediate rendering in CLI via Lynx. Consider one of these methods
  if you wish to simply read the document. -->

<!--
When writing in this manual, please adhere to the following
requirements:

1. Do NOT use css or javascript.
2. Do NOT use external hyperlinks.
3. Test html in both Lynx and a modern browser. Ensure content is
   easily readable.
4. Do NOT nest bullet points (<li>, <ol>, <ul>).
5. Use tables sparingly.
6. Images may be used, but may NOT contain important information.
   Recall not all viewers can render images.
7. Most content must be contained in paragraph tags.
8. Do NOT use non-standard html elements such as "code". Use "pre"
   instead for code formatting.

Rule of Thumb: Avoid features that would not be available in 1990.

Reason 1.   Friendly to our TTY based developers.
Reason 2.   Compatibility with GH markdown, email, any many other
            hosts.
Reason 3.   Can be converted to .txt format without losing information.
            Other formats, such as pdf, are supported as well.

    <h1>TDF Language and Development Manual</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
    This document contains comprehensive instructions regarding use,
    development, and implementation of the Test Descriptor Format. This
    document is required for anyone tasked with developing test and
    abort sequences, proving TDF code, making use of TDF libraries, or
    developing mission critical peripheral technologies. Rule of thumb:
    if your project description includes TDF, this document is for
    you.
    </p>

    <p>
    First a number of points.
    </p>

    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Use snake casing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do NOT use abbrevations for any significant constructs. This
          includes function names, structure fields, and global
          variables.
        </li>
        <li>
          Abbreviations may be used sparingly for temporary pointers,
          such as function arguments where typename is sufficiently
          descriptive.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do NOT use ambiguous abbreviations. For example "dev" can be
          short for either "development" or "device".
        </li>
        <li>
          Naming convention does NOT replace documentation and
          comments.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
    TDF programs are stored in memory and processed in a manner that is
    reminiscent of Object-Orientation. This design choice reduces the
    amount of code that handles bytecode-like objects. Object-
    Orientation structures may or may not be involved in program
    execution. Use of the structures in analysis, profiling, and
    compilation, however is uncontested.
    </p>

    <h2 id="development">Development</h2>

    <p>
    This manual contains information about development that will remain
    constant throughout the project's lifetime. Standards, practices,
    will be included here as well. It is important to read this section
    completely before moving on to the next reference document. Project
    structure, compilation, development tools, and integration will be
    discussed. Once you have completed this section, see
    development_status.txt for information about the current steps and
    history of development; most recent comments are stored at the top
    of the file.
    </p>

    <p>
    The project root may only contain two files. The README.md and
    the Makefile. The unusual casing of both these files is
    intentional.
